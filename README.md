# RecipePuppy API Handling

Handles calls to the [RecipePuppy API](http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/) with providing correct parameters.

## Install 

Make sure you have nodemon installed as a global package.

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
```

Navigate to the root of the folder and run:

```sh
npm install
```

Let's start the app.

```sh
nodemon server.js
```

That will start the app on localhost:3000

## Libraries
* [express](http://expressjs.com/) for providing endpoints and middleware.
* [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) for http request to the RecipePuppy API.
* [build-url](https://www.npmjs.com/package/build-url) for making correct parameters for the call.
